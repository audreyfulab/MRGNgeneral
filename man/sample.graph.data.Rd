\arguments{
\item{n_t}{Integer, number of target phenotypes (T-nodes) in the network. Default is 100}

\item{n_v.t}{Numeric vector of the numbers of V-nodes per T-node, or a scalar for
the average/fixed number. Default is 1}

\item{family.n_v}{Distribution family for sampling the number of V-nodes per T-node
when \code{n_v.t} should be treated as an average. Default is NULL (not yet implemented)}

\item{conf.num.vec}{Named numeric vector specifying the numbers of different confounder
types: W (intermediate variables), Z (common children), U (confounders), K (confounders
with specific properties), and I (independent confounders).
Default is c(W = 0, Z = 0, U = 200, K = 0, I = 100)}

\item{graph_type}{Character, type of graph structure for T-nodes. One of "scale-free",
"small-world", or "random graph". Ignored when \code{method} is supplied.
Default is "scale-free"}

\item{method}{Character, method for generating the random DAG, passed to
\code{pcalg::randDAG}. One of "regular", "watts", "er", "power", "bipartite",
"barabasi", "geometric", or "interEr". If missing, determined from \code{graph_type}}

\item{degree}{Integer, average degree (number of connections) per node in the graph.
Default is 3}

\item{theta}{Numeric in (0, 1), minor allele frequency for simulating V-nodes (variants).
Default is 0.4}

\item{b0}{Numeric, intercept/baseline value for simulating node values. Default is 0}

\item{b.snp}{Numeric vector of length 2, range \code{c(min, max)} for effect sizes of
V-nodes (SNPs/variants). Default is c(-0.5, 0.5)}

\item{b.med}{Numeric vector of length 2, range \code{c(min, max)} for effect sizes of
T-nodes (mediators/phenotypes). Default is c(-0.8, 0.8)}

\item{sigma}{Numeric, standard deviation of random noise added to node values. Default is 0.1}

\item{neg.freq}{Numeric in (0, 1), frequency of negative effects. Default is 0.5}

\item{conf.coef.ranges}{Named list specifying ranges of coefficient values for different
confounder types (W, Z, U, K). Each element should be a vector c(min, max).
Default is list(W = c(0.15, 0.5), Z = c(1, 1.5), U = c(0.15, 0.5), K = c(0.15, 0.5))}

\item{scale}{Logical, should simulated values be scaled to have marginal standard
deviation equal to \code{sigma}? Default is FALSE}

\item{sample.size}{Integer, number of samples (observations/individuals) to generate}

\item{seed}{scalar integer, seed for reproducibility of random number generation.}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\itemize{
\item \code{data}: A data frame with simulated values for all nodes
\item \code{dims}: A list with named counts of each node type (n_v, n_t, n_w, n_z, n_u, n_k, n_i)
\item \code{b0}: The baseline/intercept value used
\item \code{sigma}: The standard deviation used
\item \code{adjacency}: The adjacency matrix of the generated graph
\item \code{effects}: The effects adjacency matrix with coefficient values
\item \code{igraph}: An igraph object of the generated graph
}
}
\description{
Different from \code{sim.graph.data} in the way \code{V}-nodes are
included in the network skeleton: here there are just added (not simulated).
The number of \code{V}-nodes is specified for each \code{T}-node, or sampled
from a count distribution. Each \code{V}-node is only related to only one \code{T}-node.
