#' @name update.adjacency.matrix
#' @title Update an adjacency matrix
#'
#' @description This function updates the adjacency matrix of a graph based on
#' trio analysis. It is used to perform *Step* \code{3.3}, *Step* \code{3.6},
#' *Step* \code{4.3} and *Step* \code{4.6} of the \code{MRGN} algorithm.
#' This is not a user level function.
#'
#' @param adjacency numeric, an adjacency matrix
#'
#' @param n_v,n_t integer scalars, number of genetic variants (\code{n_v}), and
#' target phenotypes (\code{n_t}) in \code{adjacency}.
# Not required when \code{solve.conflicts = FALSE}.
#'
#' @param trio.set numeric, a matrix where each row indicates the column numbers
#' of variables forming a trio.
#'
#' A 3-column matrix \code{trio.set} corresponds to trios involving genetic
#' variant(s), i.e. each row of \code{trio.set} indicates the column number
#' of a genetic variant (first element), and the column numbers of two
#' expressions/phenotypes (second and third columns).
#'
#' A 4-column matrix \code{trio.set} corresponds to trios involving only
#' expressions/phenotypes, no genetic variant, i.e. each row of \code{trio.set}
#' indicates the column numbers of three phenotypes (\code{T} or \code{Q}-node),
#' and the type of triplet (last column). See \link{enumerate.triplets} for
#' details on triplet types.
#'
#' @param inferred.models a character vector of length the number of rows in
#' \code{trio.set}. Each elements of \code{inferred.models} must be one of
#' \code{M0.1}, \code{M0.2}, \code{M1.1}, \code{M1.2}, \code{M2.1}, \code{M2.2},
#' \code{M3}, \code{M4}, or \code{Other}. See Badsha and Fu (2019) for the
#' definitions of these model topologies.
#'
#' @param stringent logical, should edges absent from trio topologies \code{M1.1},
#' \code{M1.2}, \code{M2.1}, and \code{M2.2} be considered absent from the graph?
#'
#' @param solve.conflicts logical, should a resolution of conflicts be attempted?
#' If \code{FALSE}, edges are updated sequentially and conflicts are not noticed.
#' This makes the final inference depends on the order in which trios are analysed.
#'
#' If \code{TRUE} (the default), all edges are updated once. This put conflicts
#' into evidence and requires a method to deal with each type of errors.
#'
#' @param method character, only used if \code{solve.conflicts = TRUE}.
#' The method to be used to solve conflicts. The available \code{method} are:
#'
#' \code{conservative}: conflicts about the presence of an edge are solve by including
#' an edge when at least one trio analysis inferred an edge; conflicts about an
#' edge direction are solve by letting the edge undirected.
#' \code{add_methods}: add further method(s).
#'
#' @param added.edges character vector indicating all edges (and directions)
#' previously added into the network. Only used when \code{solve.conflicts = TRUE}.
#'
#' @param dropped.edges character vector indicating all edges (and directions)
#' previously dropped from the network (or inferred as non existent). Only used
#' when \code{solve.conflicts = TRUE}.
#'
#' @param cl a cluster object, created by one of the packages \code{parallel} and \code{snow}.
#' If \code{NULL}, the registered default cluster is used. Note that the latter can be
#' \code{NULL} too, in which case, no parallel computation is performed.
#'
#' @param ... additional arguments passed to or from other methods.
#' Currently none.
#'
#' @details \code{update.adjacency.matrix} takes an adjacency matrix, a set
#' \code{trio.set} of trios involving genetic variant(s) or not, and the underlying
#' structures under the extended Mendelian Randomization Principle, and update
#' the adjacency matrix accordingly.
#'
#' The registered default cluster is found using \code{parallel::getDefaultCluster()}.
#'
# Internal function to direct graph edges
